# PCG Random Number Generation, C++ Edition

[PCG-Random website]: http://www.pcg-random.org

This code provides an implementation of the PCG family of random number
generators, which are fast, statistically excellent, and offer a number of
useful features.

Full details can be found at the [PCG-Random website]. Look
at the code in the `sample` directory -- hopefully it should be fairly
self explanatory. The documentation on using the C++ code is found [here](http://www.pcg-random.org/using-pcg-cpp.html). The code itself can be found in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/imneme/pcg-cpp).
