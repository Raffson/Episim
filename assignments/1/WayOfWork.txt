(Kinda) Stepwise guide of how I worked, by Raphael.
When I say "kinda" this means it's more like a scrapbook of notes :P

so, latest version
take old vaccinator & overwrite
add Cluster.cpp/h from old
add ClusterType.cpp/h from old
add Random.h from old
replace Simulator.h with old
add SimulatorObserver.h from old
forgot to add Cluster.cpp & ClusterType.cpp to CMakeLists.txt, so now we did
replace Subject.h with old
replace PopulationBuilder.cpp/h with old
replace Simulator.cpp with old
replace Person.cpp/h with old
leave out ContactPool.cpp and ContactPoolType from CMakeLists
replace SimulatorBuilder.cpp/h with old
replace ContactProfile.cpp/h with old
replace StrideRunner.cpp/h with old
replace PopulationGenerator.cpp.h with old
add AliasDistribution.cpp/h from old and add to CMakeLists
changed CMakeLists to exclude swig/contactpooltype.i?
replace pystride with old? still getting the same compiler error as the line above..
replace entire python source folder? <- well that worked!

COMPILING ONCE AGAIN!!!
However I need to do this again since I was messing up at first...



Tying something different now, taking the versions bf89cb0 and 7faa958

so copy old vaccinator again
copy old SimulatorBuilder.cpp
don't forget to include sstream in RNManager.h

COMPILES! results are the same as bf89cb0, assuming those are the last "correct" results... thus we are now at 7faa958, skipping everything after bf89cb0

Now what is the change in terminology about? why does it mess up our shit...
trying to manually merge...
So basically, copied all files from fb4c84b which were not restored/edited
from the old version. Then it turns out some ContactPool was also adjusted,
so we take the old code, but simply rename everything manually where needed...
After that, the Infector class starts spitting errors because it's assuming
the newer version of ContactPool IIRC (yeah i forgot to write down steps during the manual merge, which is bad mkaay). So reverting to the old version of Infector, I then got a linking error because a new version introduced a new logging mode, so I kind of guessed and added some more extern template declarations, as well as the regular template declarations in the cpp file and also the missing template-class definition.

The code COMPILES again! runs fine and results are still "correct".
More manual merging should be done... but i'm getting tired...

Wondering what will happen with the "Consolidation of popgen stuff" commit when we
actually try merging this stuff manually...
