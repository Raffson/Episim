		                For our first assignment we were asked to investigate the influance of r<sub>0</sub> on the attack rate.
		                The first parameter, r<sub>0</sub>, is a basic reproduction number, i.e. a measure for infectiousness
		                of a disease. In other words, how many people will 1 person infect in a completely susceptible population.
		                The second parameter, attack rate, represents the fraction of the population that has been infected
		                at the end of the simulation.

		                Due to the fact that newer versions of the stride simulator were pushed which would change the results
		                dramatically, we decided to take a closer look at the different versions. Our findings are summarized in
		                <a href="assignments/1/EpiSim-Report1.pdf" target="_blank">this pdf report</a>,
		                however it is in dutch. We may be planning on including
		                an english version later, though this is still uncertain. Aside from that we have also bundeled all our
		                data, graphs &amp; reports into a
                        <a href="assignments/1/EpiSim-Assignment1.zip" target="_blank">zip file</a>.

		                What did we conclude?
		            </div>
		            <p class="custom-pgraph">
		                After comparing the results &amp; trying to interpret them, one thing can be said for certain.
		                No matter what results we take, the attack rate increases if we increase r<sub>0</sub>.
		                In the original results we would see that the number of infected people would be limited
		                to some extent, i.e. about 20% of the population would be the maximum fraction of infected people
		                assuming the worst case scenario. For the latest version this becomes practically the entire
		                population for r<sub>0</sub> values bigger than or equal to 4. At this point we decided to proceed
		                and inspect the different versions where we noticed a few strange things. Some versions did not compile
		                at first, but this was due to a recurring problem where 'sstream' was not included in RNManager.h which
		                can be found in the folder "main/cpp/util". Another problem was a crashing simulator for which fixes where
		                introduced during the second lecture (Tue. 13 Feb. 2018 @ 14:00) but somehow those fixes managed to slip
		                back out of the master branch during subsequent merges. Next, we noticed that some builds passed tests
		                while other builds didn't. We figured out that this was due to different versions of BatchRuns.cpp which
		                can be found in "test/cpp/gtester", where we assume that originally the absolute error was allowed to be
		                10% off. This changed to 50% by changing the factor 0.1 to 0.5, while in some other builds this factor
		                was simply left out. As a results, the ASSERT_NEAR test would pass the tests if the factor was left out.
		                As to which factor it should actually be, we are still trying to figure out that one ourselves.
		                At last, we tried running and comparing the results for a number of different builds and tracked down
		                a major difference in results to elisekaa's commit with hash "11510dc...". We believe that somewhere
		                during the refractor of the "Vaccinator" class, something went wrong and as a result the immunization
		                &amp; vaccination profiles are not working properly. This also seems logical when one compares the
		                results since it seems likely that an enitre population would get infected if the disease were highly
		                contagious and nobody were immune or vaccinated. Looking at the original results, they also seem likely
		                considering some people may be immune while most others would have been vaccinated.

		                We tried replacing the vaccinator class with its old version but have not yet succeeded.
		                This proves to be more difficult than expected since the old vaccinator class depends on
		                other old files which have been deleted, thus requiring a bit more effort to restore the
		                old version. We will however continue to search untill we find a way to combine the
		                latest version with the older version of the vaccinator class. Currently we are stuck with
		                the following compiler error:
