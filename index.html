		                For our first assignment we were asked to investigate the influance of r<sub>0</sub> on the attack rate.
		                The first parameter, r<sub>0</sub>, is a basic reproduction number, i.e. a measure for infectiousness
		                of a disease. In other words, how many people will 1 person infect in a completely susceptible population.
		                The second parameter, attack rate, represents the fraction of the population that has been infected
		                at the end of the simulation.

		                Due to the fact that newer versions of the stride simulator were pushed which would change the results
		                dramatically, we decided to take a closer look at the different versions. Our findings are summarized in
		                <a href="assignments/1/EpiSim-Report1.pdf" target="_blank">this pdf report</a>,

                        Aside from that we have also bundled all our
		                data, graphs &amp; reports into a
                        <a href="assignments/1/EpiSim-Assignment1.zip" target="_blank">zip file</a>.

		                After comparing the results &amp; trying to interpret them, one thing can be said for certain.
		                No matter what results we take, the attack rate increases if we increase r<sub>0</sub>.
		                In the original results we would see that the number of infected people would be limited
		                to some extent, i.e. about 20% of the population would be the maximum fraction of infected people
		                assuming the worst case scenario. For the latest version this becomes practically the entire
		                population for r<sub>0</sub> values bigger than or equal to 4. At this point we decided to proceed
		                and inspect the different versions where we noticed a few strange things. Some versions did not compile
		                at first, but this was due to a recurring problem where 'sstream' was not included in RNManager.h which
		                can be found in the folder "main/cpp/util". Another problem was a crashing simulator for which fixes where
		                introduced during the second lecture (Tue. 13 Feb. 2018 @ 1300 UTC) but somehow those fixes managed to slip
		                back out of the master branch during subsequent merges. Next, we noticed that some builds passed tests
		                while other builds didn't. We figured out that this was due to different versions of BatchRuns.cpp which
		                can be found in "test/cpp/gtester", where we assume that originally the absolute error was allowed to be
		                10% off. This changed to 50% by changing the factor 0.1 to 0.5, while in some other builds this factor
		                was simply left out. As a results, the ASSERT_NEAR test would pass the tests if the factor was left out.
		                As to which factor it should actually be, we are still trying to figure out that one ourselves.
		                At last, we tried running and comparing the results for a number of different builds and tracked down
		                a major difference in results to elisekaa's commit with hash "11510dc...". We believe that somewhere
		                during the refractor of the "Vaccinator" class, something went wrong and as a result the immunization
		                &amp; vaccination profiles are not working properly. This also seems logical when one compares the
		                results since it seems likely that an enitre population would get infected if the disease were highly
		                contagious and nobody were immune or vaccinated. Looking at the original results, they also seem likely
		                considering some people may be immune while most others would have been vaccinated.

		                We tried replacing the vaccinator class with its old version but have not yet succeeded.
		                This proves to be more difficult than expected since the old vaccinator class depends on
		                other old files which have been deleted, thus requiring a bit more effort to restore the
		                old version. We will however continue to search untill we find a way to combine the
		                latest version with the older version of the vaccinator class. Currently we are stuck with
		                the following compiler error:

		                After trying several things we managed to get a working version by both taking the newest
                        version and the one with hash "7faa958...". The newest version required a lot of changes
                        which didn't seem ideal. So we decided to take version "7faa958..." and restore the last
                        working version of the vaccinator class which we took from "bf89cb0". This proved to be
                        rather simple since a quick replace of the Vaccinator &amp; SimulatorBuilder classes
                        already gave us a working version, minding the forgotten include for 'sstream' of course.
                        We then proceeded to manually merge with "fb4c84b..." which introduced a change in terminology.
                        At this point we decided to start off by renaming the Cluster class to ContactPool, however
                        this introduced a serious number of issues since many of the other classes reference this type.
                        Another issue was the fact that the Cluster class changed in order to be compatible with the
                        new version of the vaccinator class, so we had to take the old versions and rename everything manually.
                        From there we simply replaced all files that were changed to fix the referencing issue,
                        except those that were used to restore the old vaccinator class, i.e. Vaccinator &amp; SimulatorBuilder.
                        These were manually edited where needed. At last, this introduced problems with the Infector class,
                        so we restored back to the old version, rename where needed and add some code since a new logging mode
                        was made. If this code would not be added the linker would fail, meaning code is being referenced somewhere
                        but the actual code is in fact missing. Thus we still conclude that the (big) difference in results
                        is the outcome of the vaccinator's refractor. A small text file with some scrap notes can be found
                        <a href="assignments/1/WayOfWork.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        Since a new working version of stride was pushed to the
                        <a href="https://github.com/broeckho/stride" target="_blank">original repository</a>,
                        we will consider this
                        the end of Assignment 1. So at this point we have a copy of version with hash "e0897fe..." and
                        commit name "Cosmetic.", with a small adjustment. It turned out that there's a small difference in
                        "disease_measles.xml" when comparing the 2 versions, i.e. the one found in
                        "root-of-project/main/resources/data" &amp; the one located in
                        "root-of-project/main/python/examples/data". This explains why the simulator would produce different
                        results when running through the python environment. To fix this, simply replace the one found in the
                        python folder with the one from the resources folder. In case the project was already installed,
                        don't forget to change the "disease_measles.xml" within the "install-dir/bin/data" folder as well.

                        The goal of this assignment was to establish reasonable bounds for the number of infected people.
                        Therefore it is needed to run a large number of simulations with different seeds.
                        Once bounds are established, we are to use the bounds to calculate a percentage relative to the mean
                        and use this to adjust the regression tests within the project.

                        EpiSim ran 5000 simulations with
                        <a href="assignments/2/run_default_nolog.xml" target="_blank">configuration</a>
                        file "run_default.xml" with logging level set to 'None'
                         (for which we summarized our findings into
                        <a href="assignments/2/EpiSim-Report2.pdf" target="_blank">this report</a>)
                        after making some adjustments to the simulator and
                        writing a number of scripts. Specifically we added the ability
                        to suppress the .csv files produced by the simulator in order to reduce the amount of data written
                        during these 5000 simulations. We also introduced a small fix where SimulatorBuilder.cpp would
                        still write to the log when the logging level is set to 'None'. Aside from that 3 scripts were written
                        in python. The first script is seedTester.py, which (as the name suggests) will run simulations for
                        a number of seeds that are read from a file. The second script is seedGenerator.py, which
                        generates a number of unique seeds and writes them to a file. The last script, plotter.py
                        (only in zip-file), is used to
                        generate a histogram from the produced data and provide some basic statistical information like mean,
                        standard deviation &amp; an interval of 10% around the mean.
                        To find out how to use these scripts,
                        refer to the comments within the files or try using the '--help' option.
                        At last, we tried changing the 'margin' in BatchRuns.cpp to 0.05 (=5%) instead of the original 0.1 (=10%).
                        However this resulted into a failing test for 'test_tag: influenza_a' where the allowed difference
                        simply became too small.
                        This could be explained by the fact that all of our results are based on the default configuration
                        which uses "disease_measles.xml". This implies we
                        should also look at the results for other diseases. Since we realized this too late we had no more
                        time left to investigate this properly.
                        Again all our data, reports &amp; graphs are bundled into the following

                        After trying out more values for 'margin' we conclude that it is possible to take a value as low as 3%
                        (though 5% would be a more conservative value)
                        while the tests would still pass, except for 'influenza_a' (as mentioned in the previous section) for
                        which 8.8% would be the lowest possible 'margin' while still passing the tests.
                        This could be the result of a bad seed in the sense that it coincidentally produces a result that's an
                        outlier. In this case the 'target' value does not accurately represent the mean and should therefore
                        be adjusted. Another possibility would be that the influenza disease simply produces different results,
                        for example a bigger standard deviation would explain why a bigger 'margin' may be needed. Since our
                        results for the default configuration (except for turning the logging level to 'None')
                        are normally distributed, it is likely to be the same case with influenza. Pushing the first 100 seeds
                        of 'random2.dat' for the influenza disease through the simulator with the same
                        <a href="assignments/2/run_influenza-a_nolog.xml" target="_blank">configuration</a> used
                        in the 'influenza_a' test case, we quickly confirm this suspicion regarding normal distribution of results.
                        It also turns out that the mean is slightly different from the 'target' specified in BatchRuns.cpp
                        for 'influenza_a'. However we must keep in mind
                        that only 100 samples were used compared to the 5000 samples we originally used for establishing
                        bounds on the default configuration, and thus this mean may still be a bad estimate.
                        Even these 5000 results are still a fraction compared to the total
                        of 4,294,967,295 (unsigned long) possible seeds. When comparing the standard deviation proportionally,
                        i.e. devide std. deviation by mean (call this result 'X' for later reference),
                        we see that for 'influenza_a' the fraction is larger compared to
                        our original results. To determine whether this is caused by the influenza disease itself
                        or by one of the other parameters in the configuration used by the test case, we would need to eliminate
                        possible parameters that could cause the issue by running more simulations with different configurations.
                        One possible explanation that comes to mind would be that r<sub>0</sub> somehow affects the standard
                        deviation, supposing that 'X' would decrease along with an increasing r<sub>0</sub> value since
                        our original configuration had a r<sub>0</sub> value of 11 compared to 3 for the influenza configuration
                        of the test case. But on the other hand the number of days to simulate is also different so it may
                        just as well be this difference that causes the phenomenon.
                        Thus we conclude that 5% would be a good value for 'margin', though before actually changing the 'margin'
                        of our regression tests we would first need to properly confirm that the mean for 'influenza_a'
                        is indeed off from the current 'target'.
                        Furthermore we would need to investigate the influance of r<sub>0</sub>
                        on this ratio 'X', as well as looking at the influance of the number of simulation days. If these
                        parameters turn out to be irrelevant, then we must dig further and see what the effects are of the
                        seeding rate, immunity rate/profile &amp; vaccination rate/profile. At last, a small statistical
                        summary is given for the average results of the default configuration.
                        For the results of the seperate .dat files refer to the report or 'stat-summary.txt' within the zip file.

		                After a better investigation of the 'influenza_a' test case, we all agreed that the 'target' for
                        this case must be adjusted to reflect the mean of about 2100 cases compared to the original 'target' (2000).
                        We also confirmed that overall the standard deviation is proportionally larger compared to the
                        measles disease, thus we decided to keep our 'margin' at 10% for 'influenza_a'. For the remaining
                        test cases we decided to use the 3% 'margin'. Currently we are generating more data for the follow-up
                        assignment to examine the effect of the random engine as well as the effect of parallelism and the
                        number of threads used. These results will be added here as soon as they are available.

                        small mistakes in our report due to bad communication. Furthermore we are trying to improve plotter.py
                        so that we can generate statistical information quicker/easier compared to R. Once this is done,
                        the statistical summaries may slightly change because we originally used the default degrees of freedom
                        in plotter.py which gave us a different result from R. It turns out we had to specify the degrees of
                        freedom in order to get results that are consistent with R.

                        It turns out our original 'margin' of 3% was a good bound for measles (which is used by the default
                        configuration) regardless of the random engine. The same can be said about the number of threads used,
                        i.e. no matter how many threads we use, the results stay roughly the same. For more details, refer to
                        the report and/or the zip file.

                        At this point most of our code representing the GeoGen model is done, as well as most of the tests
                        that were mentioned in our test plan. Obviously this is an ongoing process and thus we may still be
                        introducing improvements over the next weeks. Furthermore we've integrated a graphical
                        representation for the GeoGrid using Qt, however the actual representation is yet to be made.
                        Currently the default example of the mapviewer
                        (can be found in Qt-installation-folder/Examples/Qt-version/location)
                        is being used and thus we still have work to do
                        in order to center the map onto the correct location, place the actual cities and so on. However
                        we've managed to integrate Qt as an optional part, i.e. if no Qt libraries are found the project
                        will still compile without any problems. Needless to say, if Qt wasn't found on the system, no
                        graphical representation will be available. For more details, please refer to the

                        While we have a crude version of the code for the PopGen model (which can be found in our
                        <a href="https://github.com/Raffson/Episim.git" target="_blank">github repository</a>
                        under main/cpp/popgen-Episim/PopGen), we still need to write the tests for this particular part as
                        well as providing comments to most parts of the code. For this we obviously needed
                        to introduce a number of adjustments/additions to the code found in the GeoGen folder.
                        We've also continued working on the graphical representation, introducing a couple of improvements.
                        The next order of business will be to revise all of our code to indicate possible issues and improve
                        the overall quality of the code. We're also noticing that we'll need to rearrange some of our code
                        to have a better oversight, i.e. some parts of the code should be relocated while also grouping
                        files together in folders in a more logical manner, before continuing the expansion of our functionality.
                        At last we would like to point out that, due to unforseen circumstances, our test plan for GeoGen
                        still hasn't been updated. The person responsible for this update forgot his laptop's charger
                        last Friday on the campus which obviously prevents him from accessing his work.
                        This updated test plan will be made available as soon as possible.
